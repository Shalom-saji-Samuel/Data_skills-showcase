# A documentation on Docker 
## What does it solve?
- We can use docker containers to store different services (like java, mysql etc) and every developer in the institution need only to open the container , rather than installing all the services .
- Makes deployment of any application easy.
- Docker images are lighter , compared to virtual machine images.

## How to pull and run images?
- Open docker in terminal , Then type in docker run command with the name of the image you are trying to pull , this can be taken from docker hub. 
The run command downloads the image and starts running it aswell.
- Use command "docker ps" to see if there are any containers running.
