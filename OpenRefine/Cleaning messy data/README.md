# Cleaning dataset with open refine
---
## Objective
- Use openrefine to clean datasets

---
## What I did
- Used cluster function to fix customer names 
- Used Find & Replace function to manually do clustering , because the cluster function wasn't able to detect big mistakes in other columns.
- Split the phone column into Area code and Number columns 
- Removed "notes" column 
- Converted PurchaseDate column into value of date, as it was string value before 
- Exported in csv format
