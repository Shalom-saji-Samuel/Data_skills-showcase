## Objective
- Use OpenRefine as a metadata and reproducibility tool to show that process can be understood and reused by others.

## What I did
- Used the same mini project from the [Cleaning messy data](https://github.com/Shalom-saji-Samuel/Data_skills-showcase/tree/main/OpenRefine/Cleaning%20messy%20data)
