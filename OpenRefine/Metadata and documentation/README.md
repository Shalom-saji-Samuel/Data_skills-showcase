# Metadata and Documentation of taxonomy in open refine
---
## Objective
- Use OpenRefine as a metadata and reproducibility tool to show that process can be understood and reused by others.

---
## What I did
- Used the same files from the [Cleaning messy data](https://github.com/Shalom-saji-Samuel/Data_skills-showcase/tree/main/OpenRefine/Cleaning%20messy%20data) miniproject
- Also uploaded a json file which documents all the processes I made during working with those datasets

---
## Example of work 
- Used cluster function to fix customer names
- Used Find & Replace function to manually do clustering , because the cluster function wasn't able to detect big mistakes in other columns.
- Split the phone column into Area code and Number columns
- Removed "notes" column
