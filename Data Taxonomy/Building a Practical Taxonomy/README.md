# Building a Practical Taxonomy

## Disclaimer 
- I have used a very small dataset , which has limited the number of categories and structure I can give . 

---
## Objective 
- Exercise making a taxonomy structure 

---
## What I did ?
- I understood the underlying pattern which I could use to build a taxonomy structure .
- Added columns which give the dataset structure .

---
## Example of work 
- A product was **Organic honey** , I further added some structure by providing columns such as ;
- **Category** -> Food 
- **Type** -> Organic
- **Taxonomy Code** -> F.Org

--- 
## Reflection 
### How did this help ?
- The addition of these columns will come handy when the business will start selling other honey related items , because then there will be different types of categories , types etc .
- And by using these new categories , we can analyse the dataset easily .
